Feature: test "check xml version warning message in dble.log and dryrun"
  # details please refer to github issue #986
  Scenario: check xml version warning  message in dryrun and dble.log when the new dble version uses the old xml version #1
    #Given add xml segment to node with attribute "{'tag':'dble',{"version":"9.9.9.0"}}" in "server.xml"
    Given add attribute "{"version":"9.9.9.0"}" to rootnode in "server.xml"
